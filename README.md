# ARK presented at 23. traditional regional developer conference in Europe

Every year more than 250 developers, CTOs and other technology enthusiastic people take part in Modern Technologies and Services conference, held in Maribor, Slovenia. Conference is one of the leading tech events in the region with a proven track record of 23 years. As our core v2 was released just before the event, so this was a perfect opportunity to present the Ark technology stack to the experts and gather their valuable feedback. 

Ark was presented by our core-engineer Kristjan Kosic with the help of a community delegate deadlock (Rok Haluzan). Ark was also a sponsor of the event. 

The conference was a two day event, packed with interesting talks and workshops built around software architecture, information system design in general and of course blockchain technology (see full program here and gallery here).
