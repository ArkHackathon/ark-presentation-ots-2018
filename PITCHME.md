### @fa[history] Looking back...
- Ten (10) years into **decentralisation** revolution
  - CyberPunks movement (Nick Szabo..)
  - Satoshi
  - Bitcoin birth
- Thru the phase of disillusionment (hype cycle)
- Experimental solutions @fa[arrow-circle-right] Complete solutions
  - 1600 cryptocurrencies
  - <100 platforms or ecosystems

### @fa[history]@fa[history] Looking back...
- Fat protocols arenâ€™t new
- 1999, we saw an explosion of p2p file sharing technology
  - Gnutella (the protocol behind Limewire)
  - FastTrack (Kazaa)
  - eDonkey, and  eMule
  - BitTorrent

### @fa[server] Internet
- Current generation of shared protocols:
  - TCP/IP
  - HTTP/S
  - SMTP
  - ...

- **Produced** a lot of VALUE
- **VALUE in form of DATA**

### @fa[server] Blockchain
- Inverted relationship
- VALUE concentrated at Protocol level


- **"FAT" protocols and "THIN" applications.**

---
---
### @fa[history] Looking back...
>Most projects will fail, but the **open-source nature** of the **ecosystem** means learnings and code will be available to all.

**We can learn and build faster than ever**.





### ONE YEAR HAS PASSED
- kaj sem bral lani
- lanski slajdi
- letosnja literatura (osnove bs, p2p attacks)

- Project by ARK Community members
- The Blockchain Interoperability Platform
- Provides protocol and tools for building blockchain service marketplace
- Chain independent

---

### SO WHAT IS ACES?

Consists of:

- Marketplace
- Services
- Listeners

---

#### MARKETPLACE

A Web Application for searching and executing ACES Service contracts and tracking contract
executions.

[Marketplace is live!](https://marketplace.arkaces.com/)

---

#### SERVICES

ACES Services create and execute Service Contracts, which can be anything from uploading a file to
a storage blockchain, performing value transfers, creating smart contracts, executing code on
blockchain based computing platforms, or interacting with IoT hardware.

Example services:
- ARK->ETH channel service: https://github.com/ark-aces/aces-ark-ethereum-channel-service
- ETH->ARK channel service: https://github.com/ark-aces/aces-ethereum-ark-channel-service
- ARK->ETH contract service: https://github.com/ark-aces/aces-ark-ethereum-contract-service

---

#### LISTENERS

The ACES Listener API provides a way for all the different blockchain transaction events to be
easily consumed via a common REST-FUL API.

Docs: https://ark-aces.github.io/aces-listener-docs/

Example listeners:
- BTC listener: https://github.com/ark-aces/aces-listener-bitcoin
- ARK listener: https://github.com/ark-aces/aces-listener-ark
- ETH listener: https://github.com/ark-aces/aces-listener-ethereum

---

### WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH ACES?

- Make transaction on any* chain without holding its coin
- Deploy ETH contracts without holding ETH
- Execute functions on ETH without holding ETH
- Run an ICO

*Currently there are services for ARK~ETH, ARK~BTC, ARK~PRS, ARK A~ARK B
