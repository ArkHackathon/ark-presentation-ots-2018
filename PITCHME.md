### @fa[server] Internet
- Current generation of shared protocols:
  - TCP/IP
  - HTTP/S
  - SMTP
  - ...

- **Produced** a lot of VALUE
- **VALUE in form of DATA**

### @fa[server] Blockchain
- Inverted relationship
- VALUE concentrated at Protocol level


- **"FAT" protocols and "THIN" applications.**

### @fa[history] Looking back...
>Most projects will fail, but the **open-source nature** of the **ecosystem** means learnings and code will be available to all. 

**We can learn and build faster than ever**.
